Introduction:
Developing an intelligent document scanning system for Hardware and vision field that could help blinders, and researchers for an automatic scanning of the content based on flipping the pages of the book.


Data Description:
The Dataset is consists of 2998 images, divided into training (2392 images) and testing ( 597 images) folders. Each folder contains two files (flip) and (notflip) for categorizing the images. 


Methodology:
1. Building a Deep Learning model that could detect if the page is flipped or not flipped based on the given scanned photo for the book.
2. 
3.


Conclusion:
By applying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), the result reached to above 99% of Accuracy for detecting the images.
